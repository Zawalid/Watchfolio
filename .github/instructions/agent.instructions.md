# Instructions for Agent
- Don't run the npm run build command.
- After each change, give a brief summary of the changes made.
- If you encounter an error, provide a detailed description of the error and the steps taken to resolve it.
- If you need to install a new package, use pnpm instead of npm.
- If you need to run a command you don't have to cd to the directory, just run it directly.
- Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for components).
- Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic.
- Organize code into modules and components for better maintainability.
- Follow best practices for state management (e.g., using Zustand for global state).
