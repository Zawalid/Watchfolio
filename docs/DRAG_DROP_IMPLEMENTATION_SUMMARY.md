# Drag & Drop Implementation Summary

## PRIMARY FEATURE: Move Between Statuses ✅

**Status**: Implemented and ready for testing
**Date**: 2025-10-14

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Drag-and-Drop Infrastructure

#### Created Files (3):
1. **`src/contexts/DragDropContext.tsx`** - Main drag-drop provider
   - Manages drag state (isDragging, activeItem, targetStatus)
   - Handles drag lifecycle (start, end, cancel)
   - Provides beautiful drag overlay with card preview
   - 8px activation distance to prevent accidental drags
   - Respects user animation preferences

2. **`src/components/library/DroppableStatusTab.tsx`** - Droppable status tabs
   - Wraps each sidebar tab as a drop zone
   - Visual feedback when hovering with dragged item
   - Ring highlight + scale effect on hover
   - "Drop" indicator arrow
   - Disabled for "All" tab (not a real status)
   - Animations respect user preferences

#### Modified Files (3):
3. **`src/components/library/LibraryCard.tsx`** - Made cards draggable
   - Uses `useDraggable` from @dnd-kit
   - Semi-transparent when dragging (40% opacity)
   - Cursor changes (grab → grabbing)
   - Touch-enabled (`touch-none` class)
   - Only draggable when viewing own profile

4. **`src/components/library/LibraryView.tsx`** - Integrated drag-drop
   - Wrapped content in `DragDropProvider`
   - Added `handleStatusChange` mutation
   - Toast notifications on success/failure
   - Clean separation of concerns

5. **`src/components/library/LibrarySidebar.tsx`** - Made tabs droppable
   - Used `renderWrapper` prop from Tabs component
   - Wrapped each tab with `DroppableStatusTab`
   - Works in both desktop sidebar and mobile drawer
   - Consistent behavior across viewports

---

## User Experience Flow

### Step 1: Drag Initiation
```
User clicks and drags a media card
  ↓
Card becomes semi-transparent (40% opacity)
Cursor changes to "grabbing"
Beautiful preview appears following cursor
  - Rotated 3 degrees
  - Scaled 105%
  - Border highlighting
  - 90% opacity
```

### Step 2: During Drag
```
User moves card over sidebar
  ↓
Status tabs light up as drop targets
Current status tab is highlighted
  ↓
User hovers over a specific status tab
  ↓
Tab scales up (105%)
Ring indicator appears (Primary-400)
"Drop" badge with arrow shows
```

### Step 3: Drop
```
User releases over a status tab
  ↓
Card animates back to position
Status updates immediately (optimistic UI)
  ↓
Toast notification appears:
  "Moved to [Status Name]"
  "[Title] has been updated"
  ↓
RxDB updates locally
Appwrite sync happens automatically
```

### Step 4: Invalid Drop
```
User releases outside valid drop zone
  ↓
Card snaps back to original position
No changes made
No notification (silent cancellation)
```

---

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
[User Drags Card]
       ↓
[DragStart Event] → Set activeItem state
       ↓
[User Hovers Tab] → Visual feedback
       ↓
[DragEnd Event] → Extract target status
       ↓
[onStatusChange Handler]
       ↓
[useAddOrUpdateLibraryItem Mutation]
       ↓
[Update RxDB] → Optimistic UI update
       ↓
[RxDB → Appwrite Replication]
       ↓
[Toast Notification]
       ↓
[Query Invalidation] → Refetch if needed
```

### State Management

#### DragDropContext State
```typescript
{
  isDragging: boolean           // Is any card being dragged?
  activeItem: LibraryMedia | null  // Which card is being dragged?
  targetStatus: WatchStatus | null // Which status are we hovering?
}
```

#### Mutations Used
- `useAddOrUpdateLibraryItem` - Updates item status
- Existing mutation from `useLibraryMutations.ts`
- No new backend changes required

---

## Design System Adherence

### Colors Used
- **Primary-400** (`#5a4af4`) - Ring indicators, drop badges
- **Primary-50** - Text highlights
- **Grey-900** - Ring offsets
- **Success** - Toast success state
- **Danger** - Toast error state

### Animations
All animations respect `enableAnimations` user preference via `AnimationProvider`:
- **Drag Overlay**: Rotate 3°, scale 105%, opacity 90%
- **Drop Indicator**: Fade in/out 200ms
- **Tab Highlight**: Ring + scale transition 200ms
- **Card Opacity**: 200ms ease transition

### Accessibility
- **Cursor States**: `cursor-grab` → `cursor-grabbing`
- **Touch Support**: `touch-none` class for mobile
- **Keyboard**: Existing tab navigation works
- **Screen Readers**: Semantic HTML maintained

---

## Mobile Support

### Touch Gestures
- Long-press detection handled by @dnd-kit `PointerSensor`
- 8px activation distance prevents scroll conflicts
- Works in both mobile drawer and desktop sidebar
- Proper touch-action CSS (`touch-none`)

### Responsive Behavior
- Same functionality in mobile drawer as desktop sidebar
- Tabs accessible when drawer is open
- Visual feedback optimized for touch targets

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Dragging to Current Status
```
User drags "Watching" item to "Watching" tab
  ↓
Drop is allowed (no visual blocking)
  ↓
No mutation fires (status unchanged)
  ↓
Silent no-op (no unnecessary API calls)
```

### 2. Dragging to "All" Tab
```
"All" tab is disabled as drop target
  ↓
No hover effects when dragged over
  ↓
Dropping does nothing (invalid zone)
```

### 3. Dragging to "Favorites" Tab
```
Currently: Favorites is a filter, not a status
  ↓
Behavior: Allowed, toggles isFavorite flag
  ↓
Keeps existing status, just adds favorite
```

### 4. Offline Dragging
```
User drags card while offline
  ↓
Mutation runs (RxDB first)
  ↓
UI updates immediately
  ↓
Sync queued for when online
  ↓
Toast: "Saved locally. Will sync when online."
```

### 5. Public Profile View
```
Viewing someone else's library
  ↓
Cards are NOT draggable (disabled: !isOwnProfile)
  ↓
No drag cursor on hover
  ↓
Sidebar tabs not droppable
```

### 6. Filtered View
```
User has genre filter active
User drags item to different status
  ↓
Status changes successfully
  ↓
Item may disappear if filter no longer matches
  ↓
Toast: "Moved to [Status]. Item may not match current filters."
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
1. **Lazy Drag Preview**: Only renders when dragging
2. **Optimistic Updates**: UI responds immediately
3. **Debouncing**: Not needed (single operation)
4. **No Re-renders**: Context only updates on drag events
5. **Light Sensors**: PointerSensor with minimal config

### Bundle Size
- @dnd-kit already in dependencies (0 KB added)
- New components: ~2 KB total
- No additional dependencies

---

## What's NOT Implemented (Future)

### Secondary Feature: Custom Reordering
- `customOrder` field in database
- Drag to reorder within status
- "Custom Order" sort option
- **Status**: Planned for Phase 2

### Related Features
- Multi-select drag
- Drag to remove
- Drag from search/discover
- Undo functionality
- Keyboard drag-drop
- Collaborative reordering

## Testing Checklist

### Desktop Testing
- [ ] Drag card from library grid
- [ ] Drop on "Watching" tab
- [ ] Drop on "Completed" tab
- [ ] Drop on "Plan to Watch" tab
- [ ] Drop on "On Hold" tab
- [ ] Drop on "Dropped" tab
- [ ] Drop on "Favorites" tab
- [ ] Drop on "All" tab (should not work)
- [ ] Drop outside sidebar (cancel)
- [ ] Verify toast notifications
- [ ] Check RxDB updates
- [ ] Confirm Appwrite sync
- [ ] Test with filters active
- [ ] Test with animations disabled
- [ ] Verify cursor changes

### Mobile Testing
- [ ] Long-press to drag (touch)
- [ ] Drag to mobile drawer tabs
- [ ] Verify haptic feedback (if available)
- [ ] Test touch scrolling doesn't conflict
- [ ] Verify visual feedback on touch
- [ ] Test in portrait mode
- [ ] Test in landscape mode

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Drag while offline
- [ ] Drag to current status
- [ ] Drag in public profile (should not work)
- [ ] Rapid successive drags
- [ ] Drag during slow network
- [ ] Browser back/forward during drag

### Cross-Browser
- [ ] Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari (macOS)
- [ ] Safari (iOS)
- [ ] Mobile Chrome (Android)

## Known Limitations

1. **No Undo**: Once dropped, change is immediate (can add toast undo button)
2. **No Multi-Select**: Can only drag one card at a time
3. **No Keyboard Drag**: Arrow keys don't trigger drag (can add)
4. **Favorites Ambiguity**: "Favorites" is a filter but appears as droppable tab
